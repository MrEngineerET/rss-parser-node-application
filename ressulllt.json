The electric vehicles have also a paramount importance in reducing the hard currency the country has been incurring to the importation of petroleum and diesel.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“Marathon jumped very quickly to assemble electric cars locally mainly because it received a strong request by Prime Minister Dr. Abiy Ahmed when the latter took part in the inauguration of the state-of-the-art Hyundai Cars Assembly Plant along with Hyundai Motor Company CEO, Won Hee Lee in February 2019.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>Prime Minister Abiy’s government has taken unprecedented measures in incentivizing automotive firms engaged in car assembling business in reducing the excise tax levied in new cars from 50 to 30 percent thereby making the vehicles more affordable for the growing middle-class. The government’s measure also aims at discouraging the importation of old cars that drain the hardly gained hard currency for maintenance and importation of spare parts and they are environmentally hazardous.</p>\n<h3>Also read: <span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><a style=\"color: #ff0000;\" href=\"https://furtherafrica.com/2020/07/31/ethiopia-unveils-africas-first-assembled-electric-car/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ethiopia unveils Africa’s first assembled electric car</a></span></h3>\n<p><span id=\"more-27898\"></span></p>\n<p>According to the CEO, Ethiopia’s growing middle-class coupled with government’s huge investment in the hydroelectric projects that will make electricity more accessible and affordable, will help to boost the local demand for electric cars. Owning electric cars have benefits in cutting fuel maintenance and service cost and the vehicles are easily chargeable in charging stations as well as household electric supply and could travel up to 300 kilometres per single charge.</p>\n<p>Melkamu indicated that the electric cars will have been assembled by local automotive professionals in a view to paving knowledge, skill and technology transfer and the activity will also avail a sizeable job opportunity for youth graduated from technical and vocational education training institutions.</p>\n<p>Noting that the company plans to assemble different capacity of electric automobiles, SUVs, minibus, midibus and trucks, he called on the government further deduct the tax rate levelled in new vehicles so as to enhance affordability and ensure forex allocation to sustained operation.</p>\n<p>Regarding Marathon Motor’s involvement in the national COVID-19 response, the CEO pointed out that the company donated half-a-million Birr to the National Task Force that is designated to mobilize funds for pandemic.

Ethiopia has still untapped tourism potential despite current rugged outlook says JLL.</h3>\n<p>JLL is one of the world’s leading real estate investment and advisory firms, recently released its overview of the hotel industry in Ethiopia. With a population of over 110 million, Ethiopia is said to have one of the fastest-growing economies in Africa.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“With domestic tourism likely to recover first following the pandemic, Ethiopia should tap into the domestic and regional market as a short-term solution to revive its tourism industry,” says David Desta, Associate, JLL Hotels and Hospitality group.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Positive economic growth and the increase in foreign investment will positively impact corporate demand for the hotel sector. Addis Ababa is expected to see an increase in corporate, NGO, and diplomatic demand over the next few years. Ethiopia currently has upward of 21 internationally branded hotels under development which in theory could add around 4,300 rooms.</p>\n<h3>Also read: <span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><a style=\"color: #ff0000;\" href=\"https://furtherafrica.com/2020/06/30/ethiopian-welcomes-back-flyers-with-emphasis-on-wellness-pr/\">Ethiopian welcomes back flyers with emphasis on wellness – PR</a></span></h3>\n<p><span id=\"more-27860\"></span></p>\n<p>With poor hotel infrastructure in major tourist destinations throughout the country, opportunities could be found to develop hotels and lodges in these areas to attract domestic and international travelers.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“The impact of COVID-19 in Addis Ababa has seen 88 percent of hotels either full or partially closed and the market will take some time to recover. The opening up of the economy represents the most significant opportunity to fuel this recovery, as this would increase the number of multinationals that are based in the country, and in doing so increase hotel demand,” says Wayne Godwin, Head of Hotel Advisory, JLL Hotels &amp; Hospitality Group.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) approved US$2.9B to finance Ethiopia’s Home Grown Economic Reform program; which was introduced to alleviate challenges faced in the economy. With the opening of the economy, increased opportunities are expected to present themselves to the hotel sector. Wayne says JLL has identified these reforms and strong growth in the economy as excellent fundamentals for the sector.</p>\n<p>BY ESSEYE MENGISTE</p>\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://www.press.et/english/?p=26005#\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ethiopian Press Agency</a></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://furtherafrica.com/2020/08/05/untapped-tourism-potential-still-exists-in-ethiopia/\">Untapped tourism potential still exists in Ethiopia</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://furtherafrica.com\">FurtherAfrica</a>.</p>\n","dc:creator":"Staff","comments":"https://furtherafrica.com/2020/08/05/untapped-tourism-potential-still-exists-in-ethiopia/#respond","content":"<img width=\"780\" height=\"390\" src=\"https://furtherafrica.com/content-files/uploads/2020/01/900_ethiopia_tourism.jpg\" class=\"attachment-large size-large wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://furtherafrica.com/content-files/uploads/2020/01/900_ethiopia_tourism.jpg 900w, https://furtherafrica.com/content-files/uploads/2020/01/900_ethiopia_tourism-300x150.jpg 300w, https://furtherafrica.com/content-files/uploads/2020/01/900_ethiopia_tourism-768x384.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px\" data-attachment-id=\"20185\" data-permalink=\"https://furtherafrica.com/2020/01/21/ethiopia-religious-festivity-in-january-attracts-tourism/900_ethiopia_tourism/\" data-orig-file=\"https://furtherafrica.com/content-files/uploads/2020/01/900_ethiopia_tourism.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"900,450\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"900_ethiopia_tourism\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://furtherafrica.com/content-files/uploads/2020/01/900_ethiopia_tourism-300x150.jpg\" data-large-file=\"https://furtherafrica.com/content-files/uploads/2020/01/900_ethiopia_tourism.jpg\" /><div><img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://furtherafrica.com/content-files/uploads/2020/01/900_ethiopia_tourism-150x150.jpg\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" srcset=\"https://furtherafrica.com/content-files/uploads/2020/01/900_ethiopia_tourism-150x150.jpg 150w, https://furtherafrica.com/content-files/uploads/2020/01/900_ethiopia_tourism-200x200.jpg 200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" data-attachment-id=\"20185\" data-permalink=\"https://furtherafrica.com/2020/01/21/ethiopia-religious-festivity-in-january-attracts-tourism/900_ethiopia_tourism/\" data-orig-file=\"https://furtherafrica.com/content-files/uploads/2020/01/900_ethiopia_tourism.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"900,450\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"900_ethiopia_tourism\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://furtherafrica.com/content-files/uploads/2020/01/900_ethiopia_tourism-300x150.jpg\" data-large-file=\"https://furtherafrica.com/content-files/uploads/2020/01/900_ethiopia_tourism.jpg\" /></div>\n<p>With nine World Heritage sites and commitment from the government to achieve reforms, Ethiopia still has room for growth in its tourism sector.
